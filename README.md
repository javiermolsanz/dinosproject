### Above and Beyond

There's no extra credit in this course, but if you plan to use this project in your portfolio, you may enjoy taking this project further.

Some ideas might be to validate the form data to ensure the data is acceptable and complete. Allow the user to generate a new infographic. Move the tile colors from CSS to JS for more control. Randomize the order of the tiles while keeping the human in the middle. Create a hover state on the tiles that displays the rest of the species statistics. Create additional methods for comparing data. Rewrite the project to use constructor functions, factory functions, the module pattern, and revealing module pattern. Change out data and images to generate an infographic of your own choosing. Allow the user to select different units for the numbers and update your methods to account for this. Make changes to the CSS, and HTML to make the project your own.

### Version Control

Although not a requirement, we recommend using Git from the very beginning. Make sure to commit often and to use well-formatted commit messages that conform to our Git Style Guide.
